# Supermarket-Management-System

## General Project Description

The **Supermarket Management System** is a simple, console‑based C++ application designed to demonstrate **object‑oriented programming (OOP)** principles such as encapsulation, classes, and data handling.  

At its core, the program allows users to:
- Enter their **name, ID, and password**  
- Store these details securely in a `User` object  
- Interact with a `Supermarket` class that can later be extended to manage products, billing, and inventory  

### Technical Highlights
- **Language** is C++  
- **Structure:**  
  - `main.cpp` → Entry point of the program  
  - `Supermarket.cpp` → Implementation of supermarket logic  
  - `Supermarket.h` → Header file defining the supermarket class  
  - `User` class → Handles user information (name, ID, password)  
- **Libraries used:**  
  - `<iostream>` for input/output  
  - `<iomanip>` for formatted output  
  - `<algorithm>` for string manipulation (e.g., converting names to lowercase)

### Purpose
- To practice **object‑oriented design** in C++  
- To build a foundation for larger systems (e.g., inventory management, cashier systems, role‑based access)  
- To demonstrate **clean code organization** with header and implementation files  

### Future Extensions
This project can be expanded to include:
- Product catalog management (add, remove, update items)  
- Billing system with receipts  
- Role‑based permissions (admin vs customer)        
- Database integration for persistent storage
